## **Today's Theme** ##

- How to structure a **Navigation** tab

- How to **design** your tag using CSS


## Navigation ##

* Key emmet: `ul.menu>li>span.icon+ul.sub-menu>li*3>a[href="#"]`

- why using span tag?
    
    - `span` has an inline attribute and is similar to div tag

    - Later, change it to an inline-block model or block model 

- Most of the navigation tab consist of key points in a horizontal position as opposed to several sub-key points in a vertical position

- To make structuring easy, create several containers like div or list


## em and rem ##

- `em` : sizing a font size relative to a parent node

- `rem`: relative to a root node


### line height ###

- The `line-height` CSS property sets the amount of space used for lines, such as in text. 

- This property would likey confuse developer. (pain in the axx!)

- carefully check a line height and a size of text itself

## Animation ##

    - Today, I learned Transition, Transform, and Text-shadow

    - also a complicated concept and requried a huge amount of diving into this concept.

    - Basically it applies an animation effect, using CSS! (you can process it with JS, however with CSS, you can make everything faster!)


#### Side Note ####

1. **Flex, Grid**: you need a outer container so you can apply effects in the outer container then the effect applies also in the inner element

2. **Float**: you can apply it to the individual object

3. **Inline-block**: totally different from the two concepts above. Mainly, it changes the flow of an object
