## HTML ##


- What's important?

  - <strong>Structure (semantically) </strong>
    
    - Semantic: Making a machine understand the meaning of the process
      
      - If you put `<div>` here and there, it causes confustion to the computer or compiler. It'd rather have `<head>`, `<body>` in chronological order 

    - Markup: Focused on <strong>content</strong>, structure the content and conceptualize it.

    - tag: `<header>`, `<body>`, etc


### quick side note ###

- `<meta>` has no a closing tag. It is an encoding attribute.  

#### class and id ####

  - **Class** is like a name of a person. **Id** is like a social security number so what it means is that there could be as many classes as possible as opposed to Id. 


#### What's different in HTML5 than XML and eariler version of HTML? ####

- 1. **Markup** and 2. **API**


  - For API, it's like a utility built by someone or an organization for the purpose of effiency.
