## What I did ##

    - today, there is no class but a project with my team of 3 members including myself. 

    - The theme was following up the website that the class didn't finish up the header section. Plus, copy the header section in the website(>http://www.fastcampus.co.kr) and create the header as the website assigned. 


## What I thought ##

    - I thought I've got everything all clear and understood, however it turned out that I got it all mixed up so that the entire process would take longer than I thought it woudld be.

    - Especially, CSS is very sensitive. What I meant is that if you missed one small element or something else. It ain't work.
