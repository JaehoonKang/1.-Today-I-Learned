## Responsive Web
    - Creating a web responsive to different devices


### 1. Flexible 2. Adaptive

>   Target / Context = Result
>
>= (contents except gutter ) / (the whole content) = decimal point

## Media Quries 

- Every `Break point`, the web changes

- e.g. Min-width / Max-width

- Regarding Image file, consider `density` value.

- `<picture>` tag includes `<source>` tags to process more than one image file.


## What I felt or learned

- Today, I've got a chance to dive into the world of `Javascript`, especially `Jquery` haha. 

- Combining what I've learned so far, it exploded like a volcano. 

- In other words, Javascript can be a powerful tool to take control of elements and effects on the web.

- Plus, CSS-wise, it truly gives me bad headache in regards to the matter of `transition` or `mediaqueries`.
