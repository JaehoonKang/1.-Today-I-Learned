## What I Learned ##

1. Pseudo Element
2. Grid Areas
3. Structure and design the first Main part

### **Pseudo Element** ###

- a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected parts

- e.g. ::before or ::after 

- Especially, today, I used `::before` element to put an invisible box to check the grid space

### **Grid Areas** ###

- When positioning parts in a container, using grid areas, makes the whole process easier

- With designated names on each part in a container, assign those names to each divided boxes in the container

- e.g. `grid areas:`<br>
  `"divistionA divisionB ...."`


### Structuring and Designing ###

**Think of <em>structuring</em> first, then design later regarding dealing with HTML tag**

- Always ask yourself about whether this element is important
