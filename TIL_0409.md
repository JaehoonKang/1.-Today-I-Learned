## What I Thought 

 - Today was the first day of Javascript at the bootcamp. Everything was as I thought it was going to be. At some moments, I felt like I skipped some lessions, but one thought kept me thinking that I had not to let one single part on JS slide.

 - Even though about like 60-70% was what I've already known, I tried to find what I've missed out before when I self-taught.

 - So the followings will be key points that I missed out before.



## Basic JS

- **Literal** : a notation for representing a fixed value in source code. (`Regular Expression of an instance or data`)

- **Object** : referred to as **Container**/ **Data Structure**. When putting an instance in an object, use `{ }(Braces)`

- **Array** : a special type of `Object`. When Using Array object, use `[ ](Square Brackets)`

### Transfiler and Polyfill ###

- Both of them help converting syntaxes of old version into those of newer version(ECMA6).



## Key syntaxex ##

- NaN is never the same with itself.

- NaN is the only syntax showing `false` when comparing the value itself like NaN === NaN ( the output: false)

- Number.isNaN() => keep in mind when using `prompt` and `Input`


### Method ###

- Math.floor() / Math.random() / Math.max() / 

- .parseInt() / .toString()
