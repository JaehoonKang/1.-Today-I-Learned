## How to deal with *Slogan* and *Footer*?

## Slogan

    1. The first challenge of today: How to hide automatically assigned number when appending <ul> or <ol> tag

    you can do as follows:

        1. list-style-type: none

        2. Overflow: hidden

        3. ::before {content:""(null value)}


### nth-child / nth-type

- `CSS pseudo-class` matches one or more elements based on their position among a group of siblings.

- Using this attribute, you can select specific parts in an element(e.g. parent node)


### Blockquote and q tag 

-Both tags has a specific purpose of **quoting** contents from another source(it implies to have `cite` property )

- *Blockquote*: has a `block` attribute, usually for a longer content.

- *q*: has an `inline` attribute.


## Footer

- For a quick side note, conventionally, A `Footer` section doesn't include `header`

- when referring to `phone number` or `Email address`, append `Tel` and `mailto` property in `href=""`

- `small` tag is for a copyright


### Image Replacement Trick (IR trick)

- This is similar to `Sprite` image to put an icon in front of each section

- CSS image replacement is a technique of replacing a text element (usually a header tag like an `<h1>`) with an image (often a logo)

### Challenge: In a slogan section, a logo put in `<h2>` with a text, "slogan", I wanted to replace a text with a slogan image.

- Three key concepts follow below:

    1. Make position relative in a parent slogan section

    2. Image that I want to put forward needs to be positioned "absolute"

    3. Create pseudo child(::after) and change position to absolute
