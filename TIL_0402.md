## Theme: Form ##

- *Form*: defines a form that collects a user input

### Typical Flow ###

- Form -> Fieldset -> Legend / Label - Input


### How to mark up Label and Input ###

- The `Label` defines a label for an `Input` element

    1. `Label` with `For =""` and `Input` with an `ID value`
    
    2. Inside of a `Label`, `Input` (not using `For=""`)

* Action Property = a link to server

* Name (class, id) is used for saving on a server

#### When signing up in a website, think of all those controls in the site ####

- Especially, when you choose/ select 'yes' or 'no', it could be each label-input

- However, one label connects to one input so I can use different ways to deal with this condition: `Title` or `Aria-label`


* Also, when creating a semantic markup, I can either make a group using a `P` or `DL-DT-DD`


- What we normally think of a checkbox is actually radio and radio properties have usually more than one value such as 'yes' or 'no' so this condition requires another tag that acts as `Label` tag since one label needs one input element


### What I thought ###

- `Form` has a number of different properties and elements, even a method. 

- It is very similar to `animation` effect

- step by step, I keep in mind that I will gradually understand and practice the new world of `Form.`
