## Inline & Inline-block ##

-   What's new?
    
    - Inside of a block, when trying to put inline elements, a situation below follows:

    - e.g. `textA textB textC textD te` <br>
    `xtD` <- Here, textD wants not to be sperated

    - In this case, make this inline element have a block characteristic, which is called *"inline-block"*


## Making a virtual container: <strong>::before</strong> or <strong>::after Selector</strong>

    > These selecotors appear or work only virtually for some purposes


### Side Note ###

- `Form tag` is becoming or playing a important role. It still needs to be developed and has difficult time to apply to as many browsers as possible.

- in line with a form tag, button element, more often than not, puts away.

- Instead, in the real work environment, `a tag` works as a replacement, working like `<a **role = "button"**>`.

## Position ##

1. Static
1. Relative - Absolute
2. Fixed
3. Sticky
4. Grid 


#### 1. Static ####

    - Static position is when applying no special process or effect, it natually occurs.

#### 2. Relative - Absolute ####

    - Relative position literally means that an element is positioned relative to its normal position.

    - An element with absolute position is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed)

#### 3. Fixed ####

    - Fixed position is an element fixed within the viewport(The user's visible area of a web page)

#### 4. Sticky ####

    - Having two mixed advantages of Relative and Fixed position with a scroll attribute.

    - You once have an experience when you look at a web site and when you scroll down beyond the viewport, something(it could be a bar or nav) follows along.

    - This example I described above is what Sticky postion means.

### Grid ###

- **Grid** is so far the most efficient layout out of many layouts such as display or Flex.

- A grid is an intersecting set of horizontal and vertical lines â€“ one set defining columns and the other rows. Elements can be placed onto the grid, respecting these column and row lines. 


# What I thought #

- Honestly speaking, I am a bit confused with when or what to use regarding a layout or position attribute choice. 

- However, with all that being said, I could explore a beautiful world of CSS
